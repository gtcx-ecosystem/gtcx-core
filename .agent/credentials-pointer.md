## Credentials: system-of-record + ownership split (cross-repo)

**Canonical policy:** `gtcx-docs/docs/governance/protocols/19-agent-credential-access/protocol.md` (see “System-of-Record and Operational Ownership Split”).

- **System-of-record (SoR)**: `gtcx-agentic` Baseline vault (shared provider creds + audited access)
- **Runtime usage owner**: product repo (e.g. `gtcx-intelligence`) owns its runtime secrets
- **CI/automation owner**: `gtcx-infrastructure` owns org automation secrets/policy
- **Contracts only**: `gtcx-protocols` defines env var names, redaction rules, and artifact paths/globs

**Credentialed evidence packs:** run either via vault injection on a dev laptop or in infra-owned CI; write redacted JSON evidence only (no raw secrets).
