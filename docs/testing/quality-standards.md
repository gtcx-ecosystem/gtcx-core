## Mandatory CI Gates (Every PR)

All gates must pass on every pull request. Zero exceptions, zero bypasses:

## Heavy Proof Validation (Scheduled)

ZKP heavy proofs run on schedule via `.github/workflows/zkp-heavy.yml`:

```bash
cargo test -p gtcx-zkp --release -- --ignored
```

Must complete successfully within 7 days before any release. Failures require a remediation ticket before release proceeds.

---

## PR Evidence Requirements

Each PR description must include:

- Test results (unit/integration pass/fail summary)
- Performance budget check status
- API surface check status (if public exports changed)
- Any security or governance exceptions (with justification and ticket ID)

---

## Production Requirements

- Native crypto bindings must be used in production: `GTCX_REQUIRE_NATIVE=true`
- TypeScript `HashCommitmentZkpEngine` is acceptable only in dev/test environments
- JS fallback for signing is acceptable only in dev/test

---

## Audit Cadence

- **Weekly:** verify heavy ZKP workflow completes successfully
- **Monthly:** re-run 10/10 quality audit review and update audit report
- **Per release:** full gate sequence documented in `docs/devops/release-mgmt/release-checklist.md`

---

## Governance

Changes to this standard require CODEOWNERS approval and must include evidence of gate impact analysis. Changes must be reflected in `pnpm quality:governance:check` and the threat control matrix.
