### Quality

- TypeScript strict mode with `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`
- ESLint with `@typescript-eslint/recommended-type-checked` + `eslint-plugin-security`
- Husky + lint-staged pre-commit hooks
- 1,921 tests across 70 test files, CI-enforced coverage thresholds
- Conventional commits enforced

### Infrastructure

- pnpm workspaces with Turborepo orchestration
- Vitest test runner with v8 coverage
- CI pipeline: architecture check → governance → threat matrix → perf budgets → lint → format → typecheck → test → coverage → build → API surface → KPI → provenance → docs
- Rust CI: fmt → clippy → test
- Security: Trivy vulnerability scan + SBOM generation
- Docker build verification
